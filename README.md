CIS-568-Kinect-Game
===================
I cooperated with Aparajith Sairam, Ashima Gupta to finish this project.   
This project (Xtreme Circus) is a Kinect Role Playing game, targeting at all the players who wants to enjoy the realistic trapeze experience at home. Xtreme Circus engages player in performing basic body movements in reality to control virtual character in the game. Through out the game player can both enjoy visual delight from moving the virtual character and a sense of accomplishment from earning circus reputation.   
  
The implementation for Kinect Circus can be mainly divided into three parts: Kinect data processing, character behavior animation, and design of environment. In the game, player should jump, raise hands, or roll hands in front of Kinect. According to human joints change captured by Kinect, the virtual player character will generate a corresponding stunts, such as jumping from one bar to another bar, raise hands to catch bar, or do rolling stunts in the air. Each stunt animation and interative animation was implemented by blending physically based animation, motion capture animation, and animation rigged by motion builder.
